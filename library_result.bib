abstract = {Mesoporous eskolaite, Cr 2 O 3 prepared by using the evaporation method with mesoporous KIT-6 silica as a hard template has been analysed with SQUID magnetometry and variable temperature neutron powder diffraction (NPD). NPD analysis shows that the magnetic and crystallographic properties of the eskolaite structure within the walls of the mesoporous Cr 2 O 3 material are identical to that of “bulk” material, R 3 \UTF{00AF} c . The refined magnetic moments on the Cr 3 + ions are lower than observed for bulk material due to the higher proportion of surface atoms, creating local disorder. This is corroborated by the magnetometry results, which suggest a small amount of ferromagnetism may be present at low temperatures.},

\end{array}\UTF{2022}een investigated for their broad potential for technological applications. The search for, and eventually the theoretical design of, materials with large ME couplings present challenging issues. First-principles methods have only recently been developed to calculate the full ME response tensor {\$}\backslashalpha{\$} including both electronic and ionic (i.e., lattice-mediated) contributions. The latter is proportional to both the Born dynamical electric charge {\$}Z{\^{}}{\{}\backslashrm e{\}}{\$} and its analogue, the dynamical magnetic charge {\$}Z{\^{}}{\{}\backslashrm m{\}}{\$}. Here we present a theoretical study of the magnetic charge {\$}Z{\^{}}{\{}\backslashrm m{\}}{\$} and the mechanisms that could enhance it. Using first-principles density-functional methods, we calculate the atomic {\$}Z{\^{}}{\{}\backslashrm m{\}}{\$} tensors in {\$}\backslashrm{\{}Cr{\_}2O{\_}3{\}}{\$}, a prototypical magnetoelectric, and in KITPite, a fictitious material that has previously been reported to show a strong ME response arising from exchange striction effects. Our results confirm that in {\$}\backslashrm{\{}Cr{\_}2O{\_}3{\}}{\$}, the {\$}Z{\^{}}{\{}\backslashrm m{\}}{\$} values and resulting ME responses arise only from spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and are therefore rather weak. In KITPite, by contrast, the exchange striction acting on the non-collinear spin structure induces much {\$}Z{\^{}}{\{}\backslashrm m{\}}{\$} values that persist even when SOC is completely absent.},

@article{Kresse1996,
abstract = {We present an efficient scheme for calculating the Kohn-Sham ground state of metallic systems using pseudopotentials and a plane-wave basis set. In the first part the application of Pulay’s DIIS method (direct inversion in the iterative subspace) to the iterative diagonalization of large matrices will be discussed. Our approach is stable, reliable, and minimizes the number of order Natoms3 operations. In the second part, we will discuss an efficient mixing scheme also based on Pulay’s scheme. A special ‘‘metric’’ and a special ‘‘preconditioning’’ optimized for a plane-wave basis set will be introduced. Scaling of the method will be discussed in detail for non-self-consistent and self-consistent calculations. It will be shown that the number of iterations required to obtain a specific precision is almost independent of the system size. Altogether an order Natoms2 scaling is found for systems containing up to 1000 electrons. If we take into account that the number of k points can be decreased linearly with the system size, the overall scaling can approach Natoms. We have implemented these algorithms within a powerful package called VASP (Vienna ab initio simulation package). The program and the techniques have been used successfully for a large number of different systems (liquid and amorphous semiconductors, liquid simple and transition metals, metallic and semiconducting surfaces, phonons in simple metals, transition metals, and semiconductors) and turned out to be very reliable. \UTF{00A9} 1996 The American Physical Society.},

abstract = {Tetrataenite is a new meteoritic mineral with ideal formula FeNi, which forms by ordering of Fe and Ni atomsi n taenite. Albertsen et al. (1978a), using Mossbauer spectroscopy and Xray diffraction, identified ordered FeNi in two iron meteorites. They found it has the L10 (or CuAu) structure like synthetic FeNi: space group P4/mmm with a=2.533+0.002, c= 3.582+0.002A, Z=l. Our electron-probe analyses give (range and mean wt. Percent) Ni 48-57, 51; Fe 44-52,49; Cu 0.11-0.36, 0.20; Co <0.02-2.0,0.08; p <0.01. Tetrataenite like taenite is cream-colored in reflected light, but under crossed polars it can be distinguished by its anisotropy and characteristic polarization colors, which are clearly discernible in well-polished sections. Tetrataenite has been identified optically in over 50 chondrites and mesosiderites, where it is commonly distributed as 10-50 um-sized grains in contact with kamacite, troilite, taenite, and silicate. This occurrence was previously described as 'clear taenite' by Taylor and Heymann (1971). It also forms in two other locations identified by Albertsen et al.: rims 1-20 um wide on taenite grains in chondrites, nesosiderites, irons, and pallasites, and grains <1 um in size in adjacent cloudy taenite intergrowths. Massive and rim occurrences of tetrataenite are composed of three sets of irregular oriented crystals, which show intricate lamellar magnetic domains under crossed polars. Tetrataenite forms below 350'C in slow-cooled meteorites that contain taenite, and is most abundant in mesosiderites and some chondrites which have cooled the slowest.},
