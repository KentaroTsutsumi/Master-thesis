\chapter{Application to elemental metals}
\label{application}
In this section, we show our calculation results including the effect of spin fluctuations 
for V, Nb and Al. We show that, in the case of V, the magnitude of the kernel originating 
from spin fluctuations $\mathcal K^{\rm SF}$ is comparable to that of Coulomb interaction.
Accordingly, the estimated $T_{c}$ is significantly lower than that without including the
effect of spin fluctuations. We also show that the magnitude of $\mathcal K^{\rm SF}$ and the 
resulting amount of $T_{c}$ reduction is related to the electronic localization.

\section{Computational details}
We developed source codes to compute the kernel originating from spin fluctuations (\ref{eq:KSFdef}) 
based on the programs to calculate the screened Coulomb interaction in ALDA
developed by Kawamura\cite{KMurl,Kawamura2016}.
We solved the SCDFT gap equation using the source codes developed by Akashi\cite{RA2012,RA2015}.

We used the Quantum ESPRESSO package\cite{QE} to obtain the Kohn-Sham energies and wave functions.
We obtained the phonon frequencies and electron-phonon coupling by applying the density functional
perturbation theory(DFPT)\cite{DFPT}.
We used the GGA-PBE exchange-correlation functional\cite{GGAPBE} and the norm-conserving 
pseudopotentials\cite{normcons} for all materials. 
The scalar relativistic correction was applied to the Nb pseudopotential.
The numerical conditions are listed in Table\ref{tab:numcond}.
We used the first order Hermite-Gaussian smearing function\cite{Paxton1989} 
with width = $0.025$Ry for metallic calculations.

\section{Results and discussion}
\subsection{Superconducting transition temperature}
Calculated results are summarized in Table\ref{tab:results}.
The lattice constants resulting from the structure optimization agree with the experimental ones.
We used the theoretically optimized lattice constants in the following calculations.
The results labeled ``static'' are obtained by neglecting the frequency dependence of the 
screened Coulomb interaction and spin fuctuations-mediated interaction.
We applied the ALDA for the screened Coulomb interaction as mentioned in the previous chapter, 
while RPA is applied in Ref.\cite{RA2013}.

In the case of V, we obtain $T_c = 17.8$K with dynamical calculation without the effect of
spin fluctuations and this value is extremely higher than the experimental value.
On the other hand, when we include the spin fluctuations, $T_c$ is reduced to $8.3$K.
Although this value is still higher than experimental one by about 60\%, the agreement with 
the experimental value is improved.
In the case of Nb, we obtain $T_c = 11.1$K with dinamical calculation when we do not take account of 
spin fluctuations and this value is higher than experimental value by about 15\%.
If the effect of spin fluctuations is included, $T_c$ is reduced to $8.9$K.
The qualitative trend that the $T_c$ is reduced due to the effect of spin fluctuations is the same as 
in the case of V, but the amount of reduction of $T_c$ is relatively smaller than that of V.
This quantitatively different behavior is interpreted to come from the strength of electronic localization in each material.

The ferromagnetic fluctuations originate from the Pauli exchange effect\cite{Berk1966}: 
two electrons having the spins in the same direction are 
required to be separated in space due to the Pauli principle. As a result, in a 
nearly homogeneous system, these two electrons have lower energy than that of two electrons having 
opposite spins and the ferromagnetic fluctuations are induced.
In addition, the exchange effect is significant in spatially localized electronic states.
Returning to the present results, the valence states are dominated by 4$d$ states in Nb, 
and by 3$d$ in V, respectively. 
In the latter case, the valence states are more localized.
Therefore, the effect of spin fluctuations should be stronger in V than in Nb.
The result in Al can be interpreted similarly. In the case of Al, the $T_c$ reduction due to spin fluctuations
is not observed. This result is reasonable because the valence states are formed by less localized
3$s$ and 3$p$ states in Al and the exchange effect is relatively smaller than in the case of V and Nb.

We also calculated the values of $\mu^{\ast}$ based on the improved McMillan-Allen-Dynes formula 
(Eq.(34) in Ref.\cite{AllenDynes})
using calculated $\lambda, \omega_{\rm ln}, \omega_2$ listed in Table\ref{tab:results} to reproduce 
the $T_c$ calculated in SCDFT. 
The calculated values of $\mu^{\ast}$ with the effect of spin fluctuations for V and Nb are 
0.294 and 0.278, respectively. In the analyses in ME theory, this value is conventionally
set to about 0.10\cite{Carbotte1990}. This means that the repulsive effect of spin fluctuations 
is also appreciable in these materials.

\subsection{Analysis of the kernels}
We thus found that the effect of spin fluctuations on $T_c$ is at least qualitatively reasonable and 
the amount of the $T_c$ reduction is related to the magnitude of localization of electrons.
In order to investigate how spin fluctuations affect the $T_c$ closely, we 
consider the partially averaged nondiagonal exchange correlation kernel which is defined as
%
\begin{equation}
	\mathcal K_{n\bm k}(\xi) \equiv \frac{1}{N(\xi)}
	\sum_{n'\bm k'} \mathcal K_{n\bm k n'\bm k'}\delta(\xi - \xi_{n'\bm k'}).
	\label{eq:aveK}
\end{equation}
%

The averaged exchange correlation kernels and corresponding gap functions calculated for V 
are plotted in Fig.\ref{fig:Vaveker}. The kernel originating from the electron-phonon interaction
$\mathcal K^{\rm ph}$ is negative within the low energy region and nearly zero in the region 
where $\xi \gtrsim 1$eV. The kernel of the static Coulomb interaction is nearly constant in the
whole energy region. On the other hand, the kernel stemming from the plasmon-induced dynamical
Coulomb interaction rises from nearly zero to positive around $\xi \approx 10^{-1}$eV.
This contribution suppresses the effective repulsion between quasiparticles due to the 
retardation effect and the resulting $T_c$ is enhanced compared to that of static approximation
\cite{RA2013}.
The kernel originating from dynamical spin fluctuations is nearly positive constant in the low-energy
region. In the high-energy region, on the other hand, the contribution from spin fluctuations 
reduces to zero. 
Furthermore, the magnitude of repulsion due to spin fluctuations in low-energy region is comparative 
to that of the static Coulomb interaction. This energy dependence of
$\mathcal K^{\rm SF}$ suppresses the low-energy positive gap function (Figs.\ref{fig:Vaveker}(b)
and \ref{fig:VgapT}) and
the resulting $T_c$ strongly.
It should be noted that a cusp is observed in the gap function with spin fluctuations 
around $\xi \approx 10^{-2}{\rm eV}$. This cusp may be caused by the result 
that there is a small
peak in spin fluctuations kernel between $\xi = 10^{-1}{\rm eV}$ and $10^{-2}{\rm eV}$.

%

Next, we see the averaged exchange-correlation kernels calculated for Nb in Fig.\ref{fig:Nbaveker}.
In the case of Nb, the qualitative trend is the same as in the case of V: The averaged kernel of spin fluctuations
is nearly positive constant in low energy region and reduces to zero in high energy region.
However, the magnitude of the kernel $\mathcal K^{\rm SF}$ is relatively smaller than that of V.
As noted above, this is due to the strength of the electronic localization.

\end{figure}

Finally, we see the averaged exchange-correlation kernels calculated for Al in Fig.\ref{fig:Alaveker}.
The kernel $\mathcal K^{\rm SF}$ is significantly smaller than that of the static Coulomb interaction.
Therefore, the corresponding gap function and the resulting $T_c$ is not so modified.

\subsection{On the approximation to $\mathcal K^{\rm SF}$}
Here we should note the expression of the spin fluctuations-mediated interaction (\ref{eq:finallambda}).
As mentioned in the previous chapter, we neglected the linear term of $f^{\rm xc}$ defined as 
(\ref{eq:deffxc}). If we include the linear term, we observe an unreasonable result in the
calculation for Al: The gap function is enhanced in low energy region and the resulting $T_c$
is also enhanced. It can be considered that this strange result may comes from the frequency
dependence of $\Lambda^{\rm SF}$. Here we show the expression of $\Lambda^{\rm SF}$ in crystals with 
the linear term which is written with the double-Fourier transform\cite{Hybertsen1987}
%
\begin{equation}
	\Lambda^{\rm SF}_{\mathbf G \mathbf G'}(\mathbf q, \omega) = -f^{\rm xc}(\mathbf G' - \mathbf G) - 
	\sum_{\mathbf G_1 \mathbf G_2} f^{\rm xc}(\mathbf G_1 - \mathbf G)\chi_{\mathbf G_1 \mathbf G_2}(\mathbf q, \omega)
	f^{\rm xc}(\mathbf G' - \mathbf G_2).
	\label{eq:lambdamiss}
\end{equation}
%
In the above expression, there is a frequency-dependent term and a frequency-independent term.
The reason why $f^{\rm xc}$ is frequency-independent is that we carried out 
%a local approximation
%to the starting self-energy $\Sigma^{V}$ (see (\ref{eq:localapp})). Within this approximation,
%since one is obliged to apply 
the adiabatic approximation to $f^{\rm xc}(\bm r_1,t_1, \bm r_2,t_2)$:
%
\begin{equation}
	f^{\rm xc}_{\rm adia}(\bm r_1,t_1, \bm r_2, t_2) = f^{\rm xc}(\bm r_1,\bm r_2, t_1)\delta(t_1 - t_2),
	\label{eq:adiabatic}
\end{equation}
%
$f^{\rm xc}$ becomes $\omega$-independent after the Fourier transform.

In the original paper by Essenberger\cite{Essenberger2014}, this term is neglected based on the following assumption:
it is assumed that this formalism is applied to the unconventional superconductors like Fe-based ones
in which magnetic fluctuations are strong enough to reach the proximity of the magnetic ordered phase.
In such cases, the second term in (\ref{eq:lambdamiss}) proportional to the spin 
susceptibility $\chi$ is dominant and the linear $f^{\rm xc}$ term can be neglected.

On the other hand, this assumption is not valid in the case of elemental metals such as Al and the 
linear $f^{\rm xc}$ term can not be neglected.
However, this $\omega$-independent term is physically unreasonable. 
We discuss the reason in anologous to the screened Coulomb interaction below.
In case of the frequency-dependent screened interaction, in the high-frequency limit, 
the screened Coulomb interaction reduces to the bare Coulomb interaction because
the polarization function reduces to zero (see (\ref{eq:chi0})).
This frequency-dependence reflects the fact that electrons behave as bare ones, namely, 
they do not feel any exchange-correlation effect in the high-frequency region.
According to this consideration, the effective interaction mediated by spin fluctuations originating
from the exchange-correlation effect should vanish in the high-frequency limit.
Therefore, the frequency-independent non-zero term $f^{\rm xc}$ is physically unreasonable and 
neglected in our calculations.
In fact, there are some theoretical studies on the frequency dependence of the functional derivative
of the exchange-correlation potential with respect to the electronic density\cite{Qian2002}.
On the other hand, similar analyses on the functional derivative with respect to the spin density is lacking.
If the function form with respect to frequency is developed, it may be able to take into account the 
linear $f^{\rm xc}$ term.
