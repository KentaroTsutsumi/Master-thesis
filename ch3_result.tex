\chapter{Application to elemental metals}
In this section, we show our results of the SCDFT including the effect of spin fluctuations 
in case of V, Nb and Al. We show that, in case of V, the magnitude of the kernel originated 
from spin fluctuations $\mathcal K^{\rm SF}$ is comparable to that of Coulomb interaction.
According to that, the estimated $T_{c}$ is significantly lower than that without including the
effect of spin fluctuations. We also show that the magnitude of $\mathcal K^{\rm SF}$ and the 
resulting amount of $T_{c}$ reduction is related to the electronic locarization.

\section{Computational details}
We used Quantum ESPRESSO\cite{QE} to obtain the Kohn-Sham energies and wave functions.
We obtained the phonon frequencies and electron-phonon coupling by using the density functional
perturbation theory(DFPT)\cite{DFPT}.
We applied the optimized tetrahedron method\cite{opttetra} to execute the Brillouin zone
integration for the Kohn-Sham polarization function.
