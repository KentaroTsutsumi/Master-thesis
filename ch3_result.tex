\chapter{Application to elemental metals}
In this section, we show our results of the SCDFT including the effect of spin fluctuations 
in case of V, Nb and Al. We show that, in case of V, the magnitude of the kernel originated 
from spin fluctuations $\mathcal K^{\rm SF}$ is comparable to that of Coulomb interaction.
According to that, the estimated $T_{c}$ is significantly lower than that without including the
effect of spin fluctuations. We also show that the magnitude of $\mathcal K^{\rm SF}$ and the 
resulting amount of $T_{c}$ reduction is related to the electronic locarization.

\section{Computational details}
We used the Quantum ESPRESSO\cite{QE} package to obtain the Kohn-Sham energies and wave functions.
We obtained the phonon frequencies and electron-phonon coupling by using the density functional
perturbation theory(DFPT)\cite{DFPT}.
We used the GGA-PBE exchange-correlation functional\cite{GGAPBE} and the norm-conserving 
pseudopotentials\cite{normcons} for all materials. 
The scalar relativistic correction was applied to the Nb pseudopotential.
The numerical conditions are listed in Table\ref{tab:numcond}.
We used the first order of Hermite-Gaussian smearing function\cite{Paxton1989} 
with width = $0.025$Ry for metallic calculations.

\section{Results}
Calculated results are summarized in table\ref{tab:results}.
The lattice constants resulting from the structure optimization agree with the experimental ones.
We used the theoretically optimized lattice constants in the following calculations.
The results labeled static are obtained by neglecting the frequency dependence of the 
screened Coulomb interaction and spin fuctuations-mediated interaction.
We applied the ALDA for the screened Coulomb interaction as mentioned in the previous chapter, 
while RPA is applied in Ref.\cite{RA2013}.

In case of V, we obtain $T_c = 17.8$K with dinamical calculation when we did not take account of 
spin fluctuations and this value is extremely higher than experimental value.
On the other hand, when we include the spin fluctuations, $T_c$ is reduced to $8.3$K.
Although this value is still higher than exprerimental one by about 60\%, the agreement between 
the experimental value is improved.
In case of Nb, we obtain $T_c = 11.1$K with dinamical calculation when we did not take account of 
spin fluctuations and this value is higher than experimental value by about 15\%.
On the other hand, when we include the spin fluctuations, $T_c$ is reduced to $8.9$K.
The qualitative trend that the $T_c$ is reduced due to the effect of spin fluctuations is same as 
in case of V, but the amount of reduction of $T_c$ is relatively smaller than in case of V.
This quantitatively different behavior comes from the strength of electronic locarization in each material.

The ferromagnetic fluctuations come from the exchange effect: Two electrons having same spins are 
required to be saparated in space due to the Pauli's rule. As a result, in the 
nearly homogeneous system, these two electron have lower energy than that of two electrons having 
opposite spins and the ferromagnetic fluctuations are induced.
In addition, the exchange effect is significant in strongly localized electrons.
Returning to the present results, there are 4$d$ electrons in Nb, while there are 3$d$ electrons 
in V and they are strongly locarized than 4$d$ electrons. Therefore, the effect of spin fluctuations
is stronger in V than in Nb.
The result in Al can be interpreted similarly. In case of Al, the $T_c$ reduction due to spin fluctuations
is not observed. This result is reasonable because there are nearly free electrons in Al and the
exchange effect is relatively smaller than in case of V and Nb.

We found that the effect of spin fluctuations on $T_c$ is at least qualitatively reasonable and 
the amount of the $T_c$ reduction is related to the electronic locarization.
In order to investigate how spin fluctuations affect on the $T_c$ closely, we 
consider the partially averaged nondiagonal exchange correlation kernel which is defined as
%
\begin{equation}
	\mathcal K_{n\bm k}(\xi) \equiv \frac{1}{N(\xi)}
	\sum_{n'\bm k'} \mathcal K_{n\bm k n'\bm k'}\delta(\xi - \xi_{n'\bm k'}).
	\label{eq:aveK}
\end{equation}
%

The averaged exchange correlation kernels and corresponding gap functions calculated for V 
are plotted in Fig.\ref{fig:Vaveker}. The kernel originated from the electron-phonon interaction
$\mathcal K^{\rm ph}$ is negative within the low energy region and nearly zero in the region 
where $\xi \gtrsim 1$eV. The kernels of the static Coulomb interaction is nearly constant in the
whole energy region. On the other hand, the kernel stemmed from the plasmon-induced dynamical
Coulomb interaction rises from nearly zero to positive around $\xi \approx 10^{-1}$eV.
This contribution suppresses the effective repulsion between quasiparticles due to the 
retardian effect and the resulting $T_c$ is enhanced compared to that of static approximation
\cite{RA2013}.
The kernel originated from dynamical spin fluctuations is nearly positive constant in the energy region where
the contribution from the dynamical Coulomb interaction is nearly zero and that from the
electron-phonon interaction is negative. In the high-energy region, on the other hand, 
the contribution from spin fluctuations reduces to zero. 
Furthermore, the magnitude of repulsion due to spin fluctuations in low-energy region is comparative 
to that of the static Coulomb interaction. This energy dependence of
$\mathcal K^{\rm SF}$ suppresses the low-energy positive gap function (Fig.\ref{fig:Vaveker}(b)) and
the resulting $T_c$ strongly.
It should be noted that a cusp is observed in the gap function with spin fluctuations 
around $\xi \approx 10^{-2}{\rm eV}$. This cusp may be caused by the result that there is a small
peak in spin fluctuations kernel between $\xi = 10^{-1}{\rm eV}$ and $10^{-2}{\rm eV}$ and
$\mathcal K^{\rm SF}$ is slightly reduced in low-energy region.

Next, we see the averaged exchange-correlation kernels calculated for Nb in Fig.\ref{fig:Nbaveker}.
In case of Nb, the quantitive trend is same as in case of V: The averaged kernel of spin fluctuations
is nearly positive constant and reduces to zero in high energy region.
However, the magnitude of the kernel $\mathcal K^{\rm SF}$ is relatively smaller than that of V.
As noted above, this is due to the strength of the electronic locarization.

\end{figure}
%

Finally, we see the averaged exchange-correlation kernels calculated for Al in Fig.\ref{fig:Alaveker}.
The kernel $\mathcal K^{\rm SF}$ is significantly smaller than that of the static Coulomb interaction.
Therefore, the corresponding gap function and the resulting $T_c$ is not so modified.

Here we should note about the expression of the spin fluctuations-mediated interaction (\ref{eq:finallambda}).
As mentioned in the previous chapter, we neglected the linear term of $f^{\rm xc}$ defined as 
(\ref{eq:deffxc}). If we include the linear term, we observe an unreasonable result in the
calculation for Al: The gap function is enhanced in low-energy region and the resulting $T_c$
is also enhanced. It can be considered that this strange results may comes from the frequency
dependence of $\Lambda^{\rm SF}$. Here we show the expression of $\Lambda^{\rm SF}$ with the linear term in crystals 
which is written with the double-Fourier transformation\cite{Hybertsen1987}
%
\begin{equation}
	\Lambda^{\rm SF}_{\mathbf G \mathbf G'}(\mathbf q, \omega) = f^{\rm xc}(\mathbf G' - \mathbf G) - 
	3\sum_{\mathbf G_1 \mathbf G_2} f^{\rm xc}(\mathbf G_1 - \mathbf G)\chi_{\mathbf G_1 \mathbf G_2}(\mathbf q, \omega)
	f^{\rm xc}(\mathbf G' - \mathbf G_2).
	\label{eq:lambdamiss}
\end{equation}
%
In the above expression, there is a frequency-dependent term and a frequency-independent term.
The reason why $f^{\rm xc}$ is frequency-independent is that we carried out a local approximation
to the starting self-energy $\Sigma^{V}$ (see (\ref{eq:localapp})). Within this approximation,
one is obliged to apply the adiabatic approximation to $f^{\rm xc}(\bm r,t)$ and therefore $f^{\rm xc}$
becomes $\omega$-independent.
