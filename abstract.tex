%\noindent % abstract text

Superconducting transition temperature ($T_{c}$) is one of the most important quantities of superconductors. 
Since the discovery of superconductors, theories and methods which can predict the $T_c$ from
first-principles are energerically studied. Recently, the density functional theory for 
superconductors (SCDFT) and relating numerical scheme has been developed. Applying the recently 
developed scheme, $T_c$s for various kinds of phonon-mediated conventional superconductors can be 
reproduced from first-principles in sufficient accuracy.

It is found that the pairing mechanism of recently discovered high-$T_c$ 
superconductors, e.g. Fe-based superconductors and cuprates, is not related to the electron-phonon 
interaction. Instead of electron-phonon interaction, the effect of spin fluctuations are suggested
as the possible pairing mechanism in these unconventional superconductors. According to this 
consideration, the extended version of SCDFT including the effect of spin fluctuations has been 
developed recently.

On the other hand, the effect of spin fluctuations is also crucial in phonon-mediated conventional
superconductors. In many metals in which electrons are nearly homogeneous, ferromagnetic fluctuations
are driven by the exchange effect and they suppress the singlet pairing. So far, this effect on 
$T_c$ of conventional superconductors has not been studied from first-principles.

In this thesis, we applied the recently developed extended SCDFT scheme to some elemental metals 
and studied the $T_c$ suppression due to spin fluctuations for these materials. As a result,
$T_c$ of V is reduced from 17.8K to 8.3K, and that of Nb is reduced from 11.1K to 8.9K by including
the effect of spin fluctuations and the agreement between experimental data is improved for both 
metals. On the other hand, $T_c$ of Al is not affected by spin fluctuations. These difference of
the effect of spin fluctuations is related to the magnitude of electronic localization.
