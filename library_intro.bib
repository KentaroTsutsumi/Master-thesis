abstract = {A thermodynamic theory of “weak” ferromagnetism of $\alpha$-Fe2O3, MnCO3 and CoCO3 is developed on the basis of landau's theory of phase transitions of the second kind. It is shown that the “weak” ferromagnetism is due to the relativistic spin-lattice and the magnetic dipole interactions. A strong dependence of the properties of “weak” ferromagnetics on the magnetic crystalline symmetry is noted and the behaviour of these ferromagnetics in a magnetic field is studied.},

@article{Xiang2013,
abstract = {For spin-order-driven ferroelectricity, a general theory that includes both purely electronic and ion-displacement contributions simultaneously is lacking. Here we present a realistic method for describing the ion-displacement part of the ferroelectricity and combine it with the pure electronic description proposed earlier to formulate a unified model that can describe any spin order including an incommensurate one. This unified model reproduces first-principles results known for representative multiferroics and provides insight into the origin of ferroelectricity and magnetoelectric coupling. We find that multiferroicity in spiral magnets LiCuVO4 and TbMnO3 can be explained by our unified model, but not by previous spin current models. The magnetoelectric effect observed for BiFeO3 in the cycloidal spiral state is found to originate from the exchange striction.},

abstract = {The magnetic properties of {\~{}}1.5  nm Co nanoparticles embedded in a diamagnetic Al2O3 or antiferromagnetic (AFM) Cr2O3 matrix were investigated. For Co nanoparticles in Al2O3 matrix, a typical behavior of weakly interacting nanoparticles is observed, characterized by a superparamagnetic regime and a progressive blocking of particle moments centered at <TB>=14  K. On the other hand, when the Co nanoparticles are immersed in a Cr2O3 matrix a very different magnetic behavior was found. The system shows large irreversibility in field-cooling/zero-field-cooling magnetization curves and much larger coercivity was observed even up to room temperature. Hysteresis loop shift is present when the system is field-cooled from a temperature above the Cr2O3 N{\'{e}}el temperature. We found that the exchange bias field follows a Brillouin type temperature dependence and goes to zero at TN. These results evidence the enhancement of thermal stability of the Co nanoparticle moments, associated to the increase of anisotropy due to the interface exchange interaction between the ferromagnetic particles and the AFM Cr2O3 matrix. },

With use of this technique the domain structure in the spin-flop phase of Cr2O3 is determined with high resolution in only a few minutes. Three images with light polarized parallel to the respective twofold axes (y axes) of the crystal are sufficient to identify the six possible domains.

abstract = {In this paper, we develop a spin-wave theory of the Holstein-Primakoff type for exchange-coupled crystals with an arbitrary number n of magnetic ions per primitive magnetic unit cell, when the resultant electronic spin vectors of these ions are mutually parallel or antiparallel in a given domain, except for spin-wave fluctuations. A simple and systematic method is presented for finding a complete set of normal spin-wave modes. This method is used to derive a convenient formula for the component of the total electronic spin vector of the magnetic ions in a domain along the axis of spin alignment. We show that there exists at least one "acoustic" branch among the \UTF{2264}n distinct branches of the spin-wave spectrum when the magnetic anisotropy and external magnetic field contributions vanish. For the case when all the m\UTF{2265}1 acoustic branches existing in the absence of these contributions are identical, we prove that the acoustic spin-wave energies corresponding to a given wave-number vector $\kappa$ are of O(|$\kappa$|2/m) for |$\kappa$|→0. The situation in which a single acoustic branch exists when no external magnetic field or anisotropy effects are present is studied in detail and, under suitable restrictions, an explicit formula is derived for the energies of the magnons of this branch for |$\kappa$|→0. We apply this spin-wave theory to obtain general cross-section formulas for the one-magnon zero-phonon scattering of neutrons by the class of exchange-coupled crystals referred to in the first sentence of this abstract, when the magnetic ions in these crystals are completely quenched orbitally. The formulas in question are used to predict a spin-wave phenomenon of wide generality for polarized incident neutrons. This phenomenon is of particular experimental interest in connection with the acoustic spin-wave scattering of such neutrons by crystals of this class having a single acoustic branch and has been qualitatively confirmed by experiments on magnetite. For the last-mentioned crystals, we use an exact limit result of this paper to suggest a simple approximate form of the general cross-section equations pertaining to acoustic spin-wave scattering, when only magnons of sufficiently small |$\kappa$| are of interest.},
