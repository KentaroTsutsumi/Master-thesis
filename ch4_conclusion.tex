\section{Summary}
In this thesis, we used the extended SCDFT scheme including the effect of spin fluctuations
and explored this effect on superconducting transition temperatures ($T_c$)
of V, Nb and Al from first-principles. 
As a result, it is confirmed that the effect of spin fluctuations commonly
reduces the $T_c$ of transition metals. 
For V having $3d$ electrons, $T_c$ with the effect of spin fluctuations is 8.3K, while it 
without this effect is 17.8K.
For Nb having $4d$ electrons, $T_c$ with the effect of spin fluctuations is 8.9K, while it 
without this effect is 11.1K.
The agreement of calculated $T_c$s between the experimental values is improved for both of these 
two materials. On the other hand, the $T_c$ reduction is not observed for Al.
According to these results, it can be deduced that the reduction of $T_c$ due to spin fluctuations
is related to the magnitude of the electronic localization.

\section{Future issues}

\begin{description}
	\item[Formalism] \mbox{}\\
We found that the recently developed formalism has a problem with respect to the frequency dependence
of the effective interaction mediated by spin fluctuations. Therefore, we {\it ad hoc} neglected
one problematic term $f^{\rm xc}$. 
There are some possible causes of the problematic term. One direct cause is the adiabatic 
approximation for $f^{\rm xc}$. This approximation makes $f^{\rm xc}$ frequency-independent.
In fact, there are some theoretical studies on the frequency dependence of the functional derivative
of the exchange-correlation potential with respect to the electronic density\cite{Qian2002}.
However, similar analyses on the functional derivative with respect to the spin density is lacking.
If the function form with respect to frequency is developed, it will be able to consider the 
linear $f^{\rm xc}$ term.
Other possible causes are the choice of the initial self-energy (see (\ref{eq:localapp})) and 
the fact that we used the particle-hole propagator in order to take into account the effect of
spin fluctuations. In practice, these assumptions are inevitable to avoid the numerical difficulty 
to handle four-point functions.

\item[Application] \mbox{}\\
	In this thesis it is showed that $T_c$ of some materials are estimated more accurately by 
	including the effect of spin fluctuations from first-principles. 
	In principle, this extension can be applied to any 
	kind of superconductors because the spin fluctuations are quite general phenomena.
	At first, this extended scheme is developed in order to study the pairing mechanism in 
	Fe-based superconductors\cite{Essenberger2016, Lischner2015}. 
	Not only in case of Fe-based superconductors, this extended scheme is helpful to understand 
	the mechanism of certain high-$T_c$ superconductors.
