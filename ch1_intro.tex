\section{History of studies on conventional superconductors: Overview}
Since its discovery in 1911\cite{Onnes1911}, superconductivity has been one of the most fascinating
subject in the condensed matter physics. One of the characteristic properties of superconductors is
the zero resistivity and another is the Meissner effect\cite{Meissner1933}.
The latter means that bulk superconductors exclude the magnetic flux.
In 1950, Maxwell\cite{Maxwell1950} and Reynolds\cite{Reynolds1950} independently discovered the 
isotope effect for Hg,
%
\begin{equation}
	T_{c} \propto M^{-\alpha}, \alpha \approx 0.5,
	\label{eq:isotope}
\end{equation}
%
where $T_c$ is the superconducting transition temperature and $M$ indicates the mass of ion.
Although many results were presented experimentally soon after the discovery of superconductors,
it took a nearly half century until a successful microscopic theory for superconductors is presented.

In 1950, Fr\"{o}hlich\cite{Froehlich1950} demonstrated that the electron-phonon interaction induces the
effective attractive interaction between electrons. This idea is consistent to the isotope effect.
Based on this idea that the electronic condensation originates from the electron-phonon interaction, 
Bardeen, Cooper and Schrieffer(BCS)\cite{BCS1957} successfully constructed the microscopic 
theory by introducing the electronic many-body wave function which consist of electron pairs named as
Cooper pairs\cite{Cooper1956}. According to the BCS theory, $T_c$ is written as
%
\begin{equation}
	T_{c} \propto \omega\exp \left( -\frac{1}{N(0)V} \right),
	\label{eq:TcBCS}
\end{equation}
%
where $\omega, N(0), V$ is the typical phonon frequency, the density of states at the Fermi energy, 
and the characteristic attractive interaction between electrons respectively.

In the BCS theory, the effective interaction between electrons is only assumed to be attractive and
the detail of the interaction is not studied.
In the late 1950s and 1960s, the detail of the phonon-mediated pairing interaction, namely the 
dynamical strucure of the electron-phonon interactinon, is studied by means of the Green's function 
formalism\cite{Migdal1958,Nambu1960,Eliashberg1960,Morel1962,Schrieffer1964,Scalapino1966}. 
This theory is called as Migdal-Eliashberg(ME) theory.
McMillan\cite{McMillan1968} solved the Eliashberg equations\cite{Parks1969} numerically, 
and statistically derived an equation which describe $T_c$ with a simple analytic funcion. 
Later, the McMillan's equation was improved by Allen and Dynes\cite{AllenDynes} and the resulting 
equation often called McMillan-Allen-Dynes formula is
%
\begin{equation}
	T_c = \frac{\omega_{\rm ln}}{1.2} \exp \left( -\frac{1.04(1+\lambda)}
	{\lambda-\mu^{\ast}(1+0.62\lambda)} \right),
	\label{eq:Allen}
\end{equation}
%
where $\omega_{\rm ln}$ indicates the logarithmic average of the typical phonon frequencies and
$\lambda$ is the dimensionless electron-phonon coupling. Finally, $\mu^{\ast}$ is the effective Coulomb
parater defined as
%
\begin{equation}
	\mu^{\ast} \equiv \frac{\mu}{1 + \mu \ln \left[ \frac{E_c}{\omega_{\rm ph}} \right]},
	\label{eq:mustar}
\end{equation}
%
where $\mu$ is the dimensionless Coulomb interaction parameter defined as the product of the density
of states at the Fermi energy and the averaged screened Coulomb interaction, $E_c$ is the
electronic band width and $\omega_{\rm ph}$ is the typical phonon frequency.
The reduction of the Coulomb parameter from $\mu$ to $\mu^{\ast}$ due to the difference of 
typical electronic and phononic energy range is called as retardian effect\cite{Bogo1958,Morel1962}.
In the exponential function of the above formula (\ref{eq:Allen}), $\lambda$ in the numerator
stems from the mass renormalization, while the first $\lambda$ in the denominater originates from
the attractive interaction mediated by phonons. The subtraction of $\mu^{\ast}$ from $\lambda$ in the
denominater reflects the fact that the screened Coulomb interaction is repulsive.

\section{Effect of spin fluctuations in conventional superconductors} %%%%% Title should be modified?
The Eliashberg equations are believed to provide accurate results for $T_c$
if reliable normal-state quantities, e.g. the electronic band structure, the electron-phonon coupling,
phonon frequencies and the Coulomb interaction constant $\mu^{\ast}$, are given.
However, it is found that, for some transition metals, $T_c$ obtained by solving the 
Eliashberg equations is higher than experimental value by factor 2 or more.
For example, the calculated $T_c$ for both of Nb ($T_c = 9.2 \rm K$) and V ($T_c = 5.3 \rm K$) is
about 16K\cite{Papa1977}. 

In 1979, Rietschel and Winter\cite{Rietschel1979} analyzed the Eliashberg
equations including the effect of spin fluctuations(paramagnons). They employed the particle-hole 
$t$-matrix\cite{Parks1969,Berk1966,Schrieffer1968} to consider the effect of spin fluctuations with 
some parameters. They estimated the paramagnon contribution to the mass enhancement $m^{\ast}/m$ 
by fitting the parameters in order to reproduce the resulting $T_c$ for Nb and V.
