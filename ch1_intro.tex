\section{History of theoretical studies on superconductors}
Superconductivity has been one of the most attracting topics in condensed matter physics since its
discovery in 1911\cite{Onnes1911}. Since then, physical properties of metals in low temperatures are
studied closely and it is found that various metals show the similar properties, 
zero resistivity, in low temperatures. In 1933\cite{Meissner1933}, it is found that
superconductors show the perfect diamagnetism which means that the external magnetic field is 
perfectly excluded from the superconductors. Theoretical studies to understand the microscopic 
mechanism of these macroscopic phenomena have been carried out.

Due to the physical and mathematical complexity, it took so long time until one successful
microscopic theory is proposed. Based on the insight that the electron-phonon interaction induces
the effective attraction between electrons\cite{Froehlich1950}, Bardeen, Cooper and Schrieffer(BCS)
constructed an 




\begin{equation} %%%%%%% electronic external potential
	\hat{V}^\mathrm{e}_\mathrm{ext} = \sum_{\sigma}\int d^3r\hat{\Psi}^\dag_{\sigma}({\bm r})
	                                                            v^\mathrm{e}_{\rm ext}(\bm{r})\hat{\Psi}_{\sigma}(\bm{r}), 
\end{equation}
